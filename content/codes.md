# Gimme that Free Free Cash Money #
Referral codes reward you and your friends for pushing them to sign up with an exchange. Promos come and go. It kinda sucks to engage them in what feels like an MLM scheme even though EVERYYBODY WINS@!@! :|  I've got your back. Then send your friends here to show them why they should use your referral code instead.

## Notes ##
- There are more exchanges that will come. These are the ones I have done so far.
- This will not make you rich, but it'll give you some feel good buffer with those inevitable transaction fee bloopers.
- You need to be OK with giving your details including photo ID and some KYC financial data. I don't think there is much way around this anymore unless you are getting crypto through other means.
- I'm discerning and though none of these feel super sketch, know that I evaluate for a risk level that is small potatoes. That's like you, or I assume you wouldn't be looking at getting that $15 bonus!
- Get a non-custodial wallet once you plan to just hold.
