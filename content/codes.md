# Gimme that Free Free Cash Money #
Referral codes reward you and your friends for pushing them to sign up with an exchange. Promos come and go. It kinda sucks to engage them in what feels like an MLM scheme even though EVERYYBODY WINS@!@! :|  I've got you for now. Send your friends here to show them why they should use your referral code instead.

## Notes ##
- There are more that will come. These are the ones I have done so far.
- In general these rewards give you enough to cover any dips in value if you buy high, and cover some transaction costs.
- I'm discerning, but all these seem legit enough for the low level of research investment I'm making. Since you are here I assume you are like me and not dumping big loads of cash in. If not, please do the research that matches your strategy.
- Get a non-custodial wallet once you plan to just hold.
